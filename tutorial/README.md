# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through an application of Kover to a set of genomes labelled according to their phenotypes. We use data from the paper (see [Data](../data/)), but you could use your own.

## Outline

* Getting the example data
* Creating a Kover dataset
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets
* Learning models with:
  * Set Covering Machines
  * Classification and Regression Trees
* Interpreting the learned models
  * Annotating k-mers
  * Analyzing equivalent rules


## Getting the example data

## Creating a Kover dataset

## Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Learning models

### Set Covering Machines

### Classification and Regression Trees
** Dont forget to mention multiclass can be done and how **

## Interpreting the learned models

### Annotating k-mers
Show a simple example using nucleotide BLAST

### Analyzing equivalent rules
Show a simple example using UGENE
