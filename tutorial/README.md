# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through an application of Kover to a set of genomes labelled according to their phenotypes. We use data from the paper (see [Data](../data/)), but you could use your own.

## Outline

* Creating a Kover dataset
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets
* Learning with:
  * Set Covering Machines
  * Classification and Regression Trees
* Interpreting the learned models
