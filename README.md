## Contents

This repository contains supporting information for the paper. It is organized as follows:

* [Models](./models): antimicrobial resistance prediction models for CART and SCM
* [Data](./data): scripts to reproduce the datasets used in the paper
* [Results](./results): results of all algorithms across all datasets
* [Tutorials](https://aldro61.github.io/kover/doc_tutorials.html): tutorials on using Kover to learn genotype-to-phenotype models
